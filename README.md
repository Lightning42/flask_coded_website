flask_website_codes
-------------------------

This respoitory is for a [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) coded website. The main goal of this project is to make a fully functional website that can be used to showcase different sub-projects of mine. This repository will be updated every week or so with more progress on the website. 


What are it's dependencies?
--------------------------

The website directly relies on:
* [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/)
* [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
* [HTML 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)


Where do I report bugs?
-----------------------

Open an issue on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/Lightning42/flask_coded_website/) and I will try and review and get back to you as soon as possible.
