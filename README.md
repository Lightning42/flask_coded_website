flask_website_codes
-------------------------

This respoitory is for a [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) coded website. The main goal of this project is to make a fully functional website that can be used to showcase different sub-projects of mine. This repository will be updated every week or so with more progress on the website.

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
* [HTML 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)
